            <p>It all began in 2002 when We identified the need for high-quality care services for people living with this chronic disease.

                By 1999, MSL recognised the time had come to establish NanoCare as a separate legal entity. A savvy and experienced Board was appointed and we were firmly on the path to growth.

                This growth was boosted by a series of acquisitions within the care sector between 2001 and 2008. By then, we had earned a reputation as an experienced and sizeable private care service provider.</p>
